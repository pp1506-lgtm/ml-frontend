ML Churn Prediction Frontend (Framer)

This repository contains the frontend user interface for the ML-Powered Customer Churn Prediction System, designed and developed using Framer with custom React code components.
It provides a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend churn prediction service.

The UI delivers two core workflows:
- Single customer churn prediction through an interactive form
- Batch prediction through CSV upload
